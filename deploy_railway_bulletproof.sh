💰 Cost Savings:
   - AWS Cost: $30-80/month
   - Railway Cost: $7-15/month
   - Savings: 60-75% cheaper!

📊 Monitoring:
   - Health check endpoint: /health
   - Monitoring script: ./monitor_deployment.sh
   - Railway dashboard: Real-time logs and metrics

📝 Next Steps:
1. Test all functionality
2. Configure email alerts
3. Set up monitoring alerts
4. Train users
5. Monitor performance
