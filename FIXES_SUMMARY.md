# Danier Stock Alert System - Fixes Summary

## üö® **Problem Identified**

You were getting the **same result (193 low stock items)** across different inventory files (August 7th, 25th, and 28th) because the system had a **critical bug**: it was using a **hardcoded file path** to the July 25th inventory file instead of processing the actual uploaded files.

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### 1. **Hardcoded File Paths**
The system had hardcoded references to `"../../Inventory Report -July 25,2025.xlsx"` in multiple endpoints:
- `/key-items/alerts`
- `/key-items/{item_name}/alerts` 
- `/key-items/list`
- `/test`

### 2. **No File Storage**
- Uploaded files were processed temporarily and then deleted
- No persistent storage of uploaded inventory files
- System couldn't access previously uploaded files

### 3. **Dashboard Always Showed Old Data**
- Frontend dashboard always displayed data from July 25th file
- No way to access the latest uploaded inventory data

## ‚úÖ **Fixes Implemented**

### 1. **Added File Storage System**
- **New Model**: `UploadedFile` table to track uploaded files
- **New Service**: `FileStorageService` to manage file storage
- **Permanent Storage**: Files are now saved to `uploads/` directory
- **Database Tracking**: Each upload is recorded with metadata

### 2. **Fixed Hardcoded File Paths**
- **Updated Endpoints**: All endpoints now use the latest uploaded file
- **Dynamic File Selection**: System automatically uses the most recent upload
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful handling when no files are uploaded

### 3. **Enhanced Database Schema**
```sql
-- New UploadedFile table
CREATE TABLE uploaded_files (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    filename VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    file_path VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    upload_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    file_size INTEGER,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    total_items INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    low_stock_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Updated UploadLog table
ALTER TABLE upload_logs ADD COLUMN file_id INTEGER REFERENCES uploaded_files(id);
```

### 4. **Improved Error Handling**
- Better validation of uploaded files
- Clear error messages for missing files
- Graceful degradation when no files are available

## üß™ **Testing the Fixes**

### **Before Fix:**
- Upload August 7th file ‚Üí Shows 193 low stock items
- Upload August 25th file ‚Üí Shows 193 low stock items  
- Upload August 28th file ‚Üí Shows 193 low stock items
- **All showing same data from July 25th file**

### **After Fix:**
- Upload August 7th file ‚Üí Shows actual data from August 7th file
- Upload August 25th file ‚Üí Shows actual data from August 25th file
- Upload August 28th file ‚Üí Shows actual data from August 28th file
- **Each file shows its own unique data**

## üìä **Key Improvements**

### 1. **Accurate Data Processing**
- System now processes the actual uploaded file content
- Different inventory files will show different results
- Real-time analysis of current inventory levels

### 2. **File Management**
- Automatic cleanup of old files (configurable retention period)
- File versioning (only latest file is active)
- File metadata tracking (size, upload date, etc.)

### 3. **Better User Experience**
- Dashboard shows current data from latest upload
- Upload history tracks all previous uploads
- Clear indication of which file is being processed

### 4. **Enhanced Monitoring**
- Upload history with file information
- File processing statistics
- Error tracking and reporting

## üîß **Technical Changes**

### **New Files Created:**
- `backend/file_storage_service.py` - File management service
- `backend/migrate_database.py` - Database migration script
- `test_fixes.py` - Test script to verify fixes

### **Files Modified:**
- `backend/models.py` - Added UploadedFile model
- `backend/main.py` - Fixed hardcoded paths, added file storage
- `backend/simple_main.py` - Fixed hardcoded paths, added file storage

### **Database Changes:**
- New `uploaded_files` table
- Updated `upload_logs` table with file reference
- Automatic table creation and migration

## üöÄ **How to Use the Fixed System**

### 1. **Start the System**
```bash
cd danier-stock-alert/backend
source ../../danier_env/bin/activate

```

### 2. **Upload Different Files**
- Upload August 7th inventory ‚Üí Get August 7th data
- Upload August 25th inventory ‚Üí Get August 25th data  
- Upload August 28th inventory ‚Üí Get August 28th data

### 3. **View Results**
