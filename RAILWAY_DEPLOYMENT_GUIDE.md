# Railway Backend Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- Railway account (you have this âœ…)
- Git repository ready

## Step 1: Prepare for Deployment

The backend is now ready for Railway deployment with:
- âœ… `railway.json` - Deployment configuration
- âœ… `Procfile` - Startup command
- âœ… `runtime.txt` - Python version
- âœ… `.gitignore` - Exclude unnecessary files
- âœ… CORS configured for any frontend domain

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway

### Option A: Deploy via Railway CLI (Recommended)

1. **Install Railway CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login to Railway**:
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Navigate to backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd danier-stock-alert/backend
   ```

4. **Initialize Railway project**:
   ```bash
   railway init
   ```

5. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

### Option B: Deploy via Railway Dashboard

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Set root directory to `danier-stock-alert/backend`
6. Deploy

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, add these environment variables:

```
DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL=your-default-email@domain.com
```

## Step 4: Get Your Backend URL

After deployment, Railway will provide a URL like:
`https://your-app-name.railway.app`

## Step 5: Test the Deployment

Test your backend is working:
```bash
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/health
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Backend deployed and tested
2. ðŸ”„ Buy custom domain
3. ðŸ”„ Configure custom domain in Railway
4. ðŸ”„ Deploy frontend and update API URL
5. ðŸ”„ Set up Google Sign-In

## Important Notes

- **Persistent Storage**: Railway will maintain your database, uploads, and emails
- **Auto-restart**: Railway will restart the app if it crashes
- **Scaling**: Can be scaled up/down as needed
- **Custom Domain**: Can be added after deployment

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway logs in dashboard
2. Ensure all files are committed to Git
3. Verify Python version in `runtime.txt`
4. Check `requirements.txt` exists and is valid
